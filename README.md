# Image Search Engine using Pixabay API

This project is a simple yet powerful image search engine developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the Pixabay API to fetch images based on user input and preferences. Below are the key features and requirements of the project:

## Features:

1. **Search Functionality**: Users can enter a search term and select a color preference for the images they want to discover.

2. **Color Selection**: Users can choose from a range of colors or opt for "Any color" to view images regardless of their color scheme.

3. **Tag and Photographer Display**: Each image displayed includes tags (as provided by Pixabay) and the name of the photographer.

4. **Pagination**: The search results are paginated, allowing users to navigate through multiple pages of results with the "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons.

5. **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

6. **API Integration**: The project integrates with the Pixabay API, requiring an API key for access. Users can obtain an API key by creating a Pixabay account.
